# ADR-001: Synthwave/Chillwave Aesthetic Design Choice

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The unconference website needed a distinctive visual identity that would set it apart from traditional conference websites. The project required a cohesive design language that could work across multiple pages and features while providing an engaging user experience.

## Decision
We decided to adopt a synthwave/chillwave aesthetic with the following characteristics:
- Purple/pink/cyan color palette (#ff006e, #8b00ff, #00ffff)
- Neon glow effects and text shadows
- Gradient backgrounds and glassmorphism elements
- Parallax scrolling effects with animated grids
- Retro-futuristic typography and visual elements
- Dark background with glowing accents

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Distinctive Brand Identity**: Creates memorable and unique visual experience
- **User Engagement**: Visually striking design encourages exploration
- **Cohesive Experience**: Consistent aesthetic across all pages and features
- **Modern Appeal**: Aligns with current design trends and gaming culture
- **Flexibility**: Color palette works well with various content types

### Negative
- **Accessibility Concerns**: High contrast and bright colors may cause eye strain
- **Performance Impact**: Multiple glow effects and animations increase CSS complexity
- **Niche Appeal**: May not appeal to all demographic groups
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Complex visual effects require ongoing refinement

### Trade-offs
- **Visual Impact vs. Accessibility**: Prioritized visual appeal over maximum accessibility
- **Aesthetics vs. Performance**: Accepted some performance cost for visual richness
- **Uniqueness vs. Convention**: Chose distinctive design over familiar patterns

## Implementation Notes
- All pages must maintain consistent color palette and visual elements
- Performance monitoring required due to animation complexity
- Consider accessibility alternatives (reduced motion options)
- Document color codes and effects for consistency

## Future Considerations
Any design changes must:
1. Maintain the established color palette
2. Preserve the retro-futuristic aesthetic
3. Consider performance implications of new visual effects
4. Ensure accessibility standards are not further compromised
