# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the architectural decision records for the Unconference Mob Vibes website. Each ADR documents a significant architectural or design decision made during the development process.

## ADR Template

When creating new ADRs, use this template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[Describe the situation that led to this decision]

## Decision
[Describe the decision that was made]

## Consequences

### Positive
[List the positive consequences]

### Negative
[List the negative consequences]

### Trade-offs
[Describe the trade-offs made]

## Future Constraints
[Describe how this decision constrains future changes]
```

## Decision Process

### Before Making Architectural Changes
1. **Check existing ADRs** - Ensure the change doesn't violate established decisions
2. **Consider trade-offs** - Evaluate how the change impacts existing architectural choices
3. **Document new decisions** - Create new ADRs for significant architectural changes
4. **Update related ADRs** - Modify existing ADRs if they are superseded or deprecated

### ADR Lifecycle
- **Proposed**: Decision is under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision has been implemented
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended but may still be in use
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## Key Architectural Principles

Based on our ADRs, these principles guide future development:

### Performance First
- Mobile-first responsive design (ADR-002)
- Static site delivery with dynamic enhancement (ADR-011)
- Pure CSS implementation for optimal performance (ADR-003)

### User Experience Priority
- Synthwave aesthetic for memorable branding (ADR-001)
- Duck theme for content cohesion (ADR-009)
- Progressive enhancement approach (ADR-011)

### Technical Simplicity
- Serverless architecture for zero maintenance (ADR-005)
- File-based routing for simplicity (ADR-012)
- Temporary data storage model (ADR-006)

### Security Consciousness
- JWT authentication with known trade-offs (ADR-007)
- Input validation and error handling (ADR-005)
- Comprehensive logging for audit trails (ADR-006)

## Change Management

### When to Create New ADRs
- Introducing new technologies or frameworks
- Changing data storage or authentication approaches
- Modifying core user experience patterns
- Adding significant third-party integrations
- Changing deployment or hosting strategies

### When to Update Existing ADRs
- When consequences become clear through usage
- When implementation details need clarification
- When constraints need to be added or modified
- When trade-offs prove different than expected

### ADR Review Process
1. **Impact Assessment** - How does the change affect existing ADRs?
2. **Consequence Evaluation** - Are the trade-offs still acceptable?
3. **Documentation Update** - Update or create ADRs as needed
4. **Team Communication** - Ensure all stakeholders understand the changes
