# ADR-004: Three.js for 3D Homepage Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The homepage needed a striking visual element to showcase the "unconference" branding with modern web capabilities. We needed to choose between various approaches for implementing 3D graphics and animations.

## Decision
We implemented Three.js (r128) via CDN for the homepage 3D experience featuring:
- Rotating "UNCONFERENCE" text with individual letter animations
- 2000+ animated stars with color variations (purple, pink, cyan)
- Real-time animations with 60fps performance target
- WebGL rendering with fallback considerations
- Interactive parallax effects

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Visual Impact**: Creates memorable first impression and wow factor
- **Modern Technology**: Demonstrates technical capabilities and innovation
- **Brand Reinforcement**: 3D "UNCONFERENCE" text prominently displays core branding
- **User Engagement**: Interactive animations encourage exploration
- **Performance**: Hardware-accelerated WebGL rendering
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes effectively

### Negative
- **Browser Compatibility**: Requires WebGL support (95%+ modern browsers)
- **Performance Impact**: Higher CPU/GPU usage, potential battery drain on mobile
- **Load Time**: Additional 580KB JavaScript library download
- **Complexity**: More complex debugging and maintenance
- **Accessibility**: Screen readers cannot interpret 3D content
- **SEO Impact**: 3D content not indexable by search engines

### Trade-offs
- **Visual Appeal vs. Performance**: Accepted performance cost for dramatic visual impact
- **Innovation vs. Compatibility**: Prioritized modern browsers over legacy support
- **Branding vs. Accessibility**: Chose visual branding over optimal accessibility
- **Complexity vs. Maintainability**: Accepted technical complexity for unique experience

## Technical Implementation
- Three.js loaded from CDN (cdnjs.cloudflare.com)
- WebGL renderer with alpha transparency
- Individual letter meshes with independent animations
- Particle system for star field effects
- Responsive canvas that adapts to window resize
- Animation loop optimized for 60fps

## Performance Considerations
- Stars limited to 2000 particles for performance balance
- Simplified geometry (planes) instead of complex 3D text meshes
- Animation throttling on slower devices (future consideration)
- Memory cleanup on page navigation

## Risk Mitigation
- Graceful degradation if WebGL unavailable (future: fallback to 2D canvas)
- Performance monitoring for frame rate drops
- Memory leak prevention with proper cleanup
- Mobile optimization with reduced particle counts

## Future Constraints
Changes to homepage must:
1. Maintain 60fps performance target
2. Preserve "UNCONFERENCE" branding prominence
3. Consider mobile device limitations
4. Test across different GPU capabilities
5. Ensure accessibility alternatives exist
6. Monitor bundle size impact

## Potential Evolution
- Add WebGL feature detection with 2D fallback
- Implement performance scaling based on device capabilities
- Consider Web Workers for animation calculations
- Add accessibility descriptions for 3D content
