# ADR-003: Pure CSS Implementation Without Frameworks

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project required custom styling for the synthwave aesthetic and complex animations. We needed to decide between using CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.) or implementing pure CSS solutions.

## Decision
We chose to implement all styling using pure CSS without any CSS frameworks, organizing styles across multiple focused CSS files:
- `synthwave-bg.css` - Background effects and animations
- `responsive.css` - Mobile-first responsive utilities
- `footer.css` - Footer and crypto ticker styling
- Inline styles within individual HTML files for page-specific styling

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Complete Creative Control**: No framework constraints on design implementation
- **Optimal Performance**: Only load CSS that's actually needed
- **Custom Animations**: Full control over complex synthwave effects and transitions
- **Learning Value**: Deeper understanding of CSS capabilities and best practices
- **No Framework Dependencies**: Reduced external dependencies and potential security issues

### Negative
- **Development Time**: Longer initial development compared to framework shortcuts
- **Code Duplication**: Some repeated patterns across different components
- **Maintenance Overhead**: More CSS to maintain and debug
- **Browser Compatibility**: Need to handle cross-browser issues manually
- **Team Onboarding**: New developers need to learn custom CSS patterns

### Trade-offs
- **Development Speed vs. Customization**: Accepted slower initial development for complete design control
- **Code Volume vs. Performance**: More CSS lines but better runtime performance
- **Maintainability vs. Flexibility**: Custom code requires more maintenance but offers unlimited flexibility
- **Learning Curve vs. Rapid Prototyping**: Chose educational value over rapid iteration

## Implementation Strategy
- Modular CSS files organized by purpose
- CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming
- BEM-like naming conventions for clarity
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Extensive use of CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Custom animation keyframes for synthwave effects

## Quality Gates
New styling must:
1. Follow established naming conventions
2. Use CSS custom properties for theme values
3. Implement mobile-first responsive design
4. Avoid !important declarations unless absolutely necessary
5. Include fallbacks for experimental CSS features
6. Be tested across major browsers

## Future Considerations
- Consider CSS preprocessor (Sass/Less) if complexity grows significantly
- Document CSS architecture patterns for team consistency
- Potential framework adoption only if custom CSS becomes unmaintainable
- Performance monitoring as CSS complexity increases
