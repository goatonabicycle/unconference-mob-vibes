# ADR-012: Navigation and Routing Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The unconference website required navigation that would work across multiple pages with different content types (3D homepage, games, galleries, forms) while maintaining consistency and accessibility across desktop and mobile devices.

## Decision
We implemented a traditional multi-page navigation approach with:
- Consistent navigation header across all pages
- File-based routing (direct HTML file access)
- Mobile hamburger menu with responsive breakpoints
- Authentication-aware navigation (login/logout states)
- Fixed navigation with smooth transitions
- Manual navigation updates for new pages

## Consequences

### Positive
- **SEO Benefits**: Each page has unique URL and can be directly linked/bookmarked
- **Browser Compatibility**: Works with all browsers and JavaScript disabled
- **Simple Implementation**: No complex routing logic or state management
- **Fast Navigation**: Direct file access without client-side route resolution
- **Accessibility**: Standard browser navigation behavior (back/forward buttons)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: JavaScript enhances but isn't required for navigation

### Negative
- **Code Duplication**: Navigation HTML repeated across all pages
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Adding new pages requires updating all navigation menus
- **Full Page Loads**: No single-page application benefits (faster transitions)
- **State Loss**: Page transitions lose client-side application state
- **Bundle Size**: JavaScript libraries loaded on each page navigation

### Trade-offs
- **Simplicity vs. Performance**: Chose simple implementation over SPA optimizations
- **SEO vs. UX**: Prioritized search engine optimization over smooth transitions
- **Maintenance vs. Flexibility**: Accepted duplication for implementation simplicity
- **Compatibility vs. Features**: Standard behavior over advanced routing features

## Navigation Structure

### Desktop Navigation
- Horizontal navigation bar with all page links
- Fixed positioning for consistent access
- Hover effects and visual feedback
- Login/logout state management

### Mobile Navigation
- Hamburger menu (☰) for space efficiency
- Slide-down menu with full-screen overlay
- Touch-friendly tap targets (44px minimum)
- Auto-close on outside click or navigation

### Page Hierarchy
```
Home (index.html)
├── About (index.html#about)
├── Services (index.html#services)
├── Contact (contact.html) - Recipe content
├── Go here (go-here.html) - Infinite redirect
├── From here (from-here.html) - Infinite redirect
├── World Map (world-map.html) - Interactive recipe map
├── Duck Game (duck-game.html) - Pong game
├── Gallery (gallery.html) - Duck photography
└── Login (login.html) - Authentication
```

## Responsive Behavior

### Mobile (< 768px)
- Hamburger menu replaces horizontal navigation
- Vertical menu layout with full-width items
- Touch-optimized spacing and interactions
- Menu slides down from top with backdrop

### Desktop (≥ 768px)
- Horizontal navigation with flex layout
- Hover effects and transitions
- Login button styled as call-to-action
- Maximum width constraint for large screens

## Authentication Integration
- Dynamic navigation updates based on login state
- "Login" becomes "Hi, [Name]! | Logout" when authenticated
- AuthManager class handles navigation state updates
- Automatic navigation refresh on authentication changes

## JavaScript Enhancement
```javascript
// Mobile menu toggle
function toggleMobileMenu() {
  const menu = document.querySelector('nav ul');
  menu.classList.toggle('show');
}

// Authentication-aware navigation updates
authManager.updateNavigation();
```

## Accessibility Features
- Semantic navigation markup (`<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`)
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly menu structure
- Focus management for mobile menu
- Skip links for main content access

## Performance Considerations
- CSS transitions for smooth menu animations
- No JavaScript required for basic navigation
- Minimal DOM manipulation for mobile menu
- Efficient event handling (outside click detection)

## URL Strategy
- Clean, descriptive URLs for each page
- Hash fragments for same-page sections (#about, #services)
- No URL parameters or complex routing patterns
- Direct file access for fast loading

## Future Constraints
Navigation changes must:
1. Update all HTML files consistently
2. Maintain responsive behavior across breakpoints
3. Preserve accessibility features
4. Consider authentication state changes
5. Test mobile menu functionality thoroughly
6. Maintain semantic markup structure

## Migration Considerations
If moving to SPA routing:
- URL structure can be preserved
- Navigation component can be extracted
- Authentication integration patterns remain valid
- Mobile menu logic can be reused

## Quality Assurance
Navigation updates require:
- Cross-page consistency verification
- Mobile menu testing on various devices
- Authentication flow testing
- Accessibility audit with screen readers
- Keyboard navigation verification
- Performance impact assessment

## Analytics and Monitoring
Track navigation usage:
- Page transition patterns
- Mobile menu usage rates
- Authentication flow completion
- Navigation error rates
- User journey analysis
