# ADR-005: Vercel Serverless Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The unconference website required backend functionality for user authentication while maintaining simplicity and scalability. We needed to choose between traditional server hosting, containerized solutions, or serverless architecture.

## Decision
We adopted Vercel's serverless function architecture with:
- Node.js 18.x runtime for API endpoints
- File-based routing in `/api` directory
- Automatic scaling and deployment
- Integration with Vercel KV (Redis) for data persistence
- Environment variable management through Vercel dashboard

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Zero Server Management**: No infrastructure maintenance or scaling concerns
- **Automatic Scaling**: Functions scale automatically with traffic
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-per-request pricing model
- **Fast Deployment**: Instant deployments with git integration
- **Global CDN**: Worldwide edge locations for low latency
- **Development Experience**: Local development with `vercel dev`
- **Security**: Automatic HTTPS and security patches

### Negative
- **Cold Starts**: Initial request latency for infrequently used functions
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Tight coupling with Vercel ecosystem
- **Execution Limits**: 10-second timeout for Hobby plan functions
- **Stateless Nature**: No persistent memory between requests
- **Local Development Complexity**: Requires Vercel CLI for full feature testing
- **Cost Unpredictability**: Pricing based on usage can scale unexpectedly

### Trade-offs
- **Simplicity vs. Control**: Gained operational simplicity at cost of infrastructure control
- **Development Speed vs. Vendor Dependency**: Fast development with platform lock-in risk
- **Cost vs. Performance**: Variable costs but excellent performance characteristics
- **Scalability vs. Architecture Constraints**: Infinite scale with stateless limitations

## Architecture Decisions
- RESTful API design with proper HTTP methods
- Stateless request handling
- External data persistence (Vercel KV)
- Environment-based configuration
- CORS handling for cross-origin requests

## API Endpoints Implemented
- `POST /api/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/login` - User authentication
- `GET /api/validate` - Token validation

## Quality Requirements
All serverless functions must:
1. Complete within 10-second timeout limit
2. Handle errors gracefully with proper HTTP status codes
3. Implement proper CORS headers
4. Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
5. Include comprehensive error logging
6. Return consistent JSON response format

## Monitoring and Observability
- Vercel Analytics for function performance
- Error logging to Redis for debugging
- Response time monitoring
- Usage pattern analysis

## Security Considerations
- Environment variable encryption
- CORS policy enforcement
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting (Vercel-provided)
- No sensitive data in function code

## Migration Considerations
If moving away from Vercel:
- Functions use standard Node.js (portable)
- Environment variables documented in `.env.example`
- Database abstraction through Redis client
- Standard HTTP interfaces for API compatibility

## Future Constraints
New serverless functions must:
1. Follow established error handling patterns
2. Implement proper authentication where required
3. Include comprehensive input validation
4. Maintain stateless design principles
5. Document API contracts clearly
6. Consider cold start optimization
