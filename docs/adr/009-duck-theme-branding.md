# ADR-009: Duck Theme as Central Branding Element

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The unconference website needed a cohesive thematic element that could tie together disparate content areas (recipes, games, gallery) while creating a memorable and engaging user experience. The duck theme emerged as a unifying concept.

## Decision
We adopted ducks as the central thematic element throughout the site with:
- Duck emoji (ðŸ¦†) as primary visual motif
- Duck-focused recipe content (Dakka La Range, global duck recipes)
- Duck Pong game with duck emoji as the ball
- Duck photography gallery
- Hidden duck Easter eggs
- Duck-related content in world map recipes

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Memorable Branding**: Unique and memorable theme that differentiates the site
- **Content Cohesion**: Unifies diverse content areas under single theme
- **User Engagement**: Playful theme encourages exploration and interaction
- **SEO Benefits**: Focused keyword strategy around duck-related content
- **Cultural Appeal**: Ducks are universally recognized and generally liked
- **Emoji Compatibility**: Duck emoji works across all platforms and devices
- **Easter Egg Opportunities**: Theme provides natural hiding spots for surprises

### Negative

- **Professional Perception**: Playful theme might reduce perceived seriousness
- **Scalability Concerns**: Theme may become limiting as site grows
- **Translation Issues**: Duck-related puns and references may not translate well
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Theme consistency requires ongoing attention

### Trade-offs
