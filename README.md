## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This project uses ADRs to document important architectural and design decisions. All ADRs are located in `docs/adr/` and include:

- Design decisions (synthwave aesthetic, mobile-first approach, duck theme)
- Technical architecture (serverless functions, Redis storage, JWT auth)
- Implementation strategies (pure CSS, Three.js integration, Easter eggs)

### Checking ADR Compliance

Before making significant changes, run the ADR compliance checker:

```bash
npm run check-adr
```

This will validate that changes don't violate established architectural decisions.

### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Mobile-First Design** - All features must work on mobile devices first
2. **Synthwave Aesthetic** - Maintain purple/pink/cyan color palette and glow effects
3. **Duck Theme Consistency** - Integrate duck elements naturally throughout
4. **Performance First** - Static delivery with dynamic enhancement
5. **Security Conscious** - JWT auth, input validation, comprehensive logging
